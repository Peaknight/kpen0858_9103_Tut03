## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
**Example:** Remember Me* (Game, 2013)
In the game "Remember Me", player can rotate the mouse or joystick to achieve the effect of memory replay, and the speed of replay can be affected by the rotation speed. 
'Wheels of fortune' which has a lot of circular and chain-like designs. Refer to the above operations to achieve an effect of repeatedly using the mouse to rotate and slide to start the circular rotated animation in the picture?
I think this will make the finished work more interactive and fun, like playing a game.

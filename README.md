# Quiz 8: Design Research
## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
In the 2013 game __"Remember Me"__, player can __rotate the mouse or joystick to achieve the effect of memory replay__, and the speed of replay can be affected by the rotation speed. 
__'Wheels of fortune'__ which has a lot of circular and chain-like designs. Refer to the above operations to achieve an effect of repeatedly using the mouse to rotate and slide to start the circular rotated animation in the picture?
I think this will make the finished work more interactive and fun, like playing a game.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
There is an example called Smoke Particles on the official website of P5.JS. Its smoke will swing with the displacement movement of the mouse on the x-axis, and can produce different effects according to the speed of different x-axis sliding.
So, I think in this example, it’s vector operation, mouse movement operation these coding techniques will effectively assist my conception.
For example, calculate the movement of the mouse x-axis and y-axis is to get the mouse rotation data, and use this to affect the rotation effect of the circular part in the picture.
